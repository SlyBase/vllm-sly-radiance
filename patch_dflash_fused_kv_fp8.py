"""Let the DFlash context-KV precompute work with a quantized drafter.

`precompute_and_store_context_kv` fuses every layer's K/V projection into one GEMM, and it builds
that fused weight by slicing the raw parameter: `a.qkv_proj.weight[a.q_size:]`. Every assumption
behind that slice fails once the drafter checkpoint is quantized:

  * the parameter is float8_e4m3fn, so the F.linear against bf16 activations raises outright;
  * the rows are not where the slice expects them -- our preshuffle load hook rewrites block-fp8
    weights to [N//16, K*16], so row `q_size` is no longer the first K row; and
  * the buffer is built at the end of load_weights, before the quant method has processed the
    weights at all, so nothing can be read out of them yet.

Rather than teach this path about every weight layout, ask the layer for its own effective weight:
running the identity through `qkv_proj` returns W^T whatever the quant method and layout underneath.
A one-hot row has amax 1, so its activation quantization is exact and the result is the dequantized
weight rounded to the compute dtype -- precisely what the fused GEMM would have multiplied by. The
build is deferred to first use, which is the profile run, so the weights are fully processed and the
allocation still happens long before any CUDA graph capture. Steady-state memory is unchanged: the
fused buffer is the same bf16 tensor the unquantized path builds.

An unquantized drafter keeps the original eager slice, so the bf16 configuration is untouched.
