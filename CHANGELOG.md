# Changelog

Every image version (`VERSION`, image tag `vllm-sly-radiance:<version>-rocm10.0`) has a section here.
The section of a version is the body of its GitHub release: `ci/release_tag.sh` publishes it when the
`v<version>` tag is cut, and `ci/check_consistency.py` fails a PR that bumps `VERSION` without one.
Measurements are on one AMD Radeon AI PRO R9700 with `amd/Qwen3.8-27B-Quark-AWQ-MXFP4` + the DFlash2
W4A16 drafter and the production arguments; deep dives are in [docs/TECHNICAL.md](docs/TECHNICAL.md),
full benchmark tables in [docs/BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md).

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versions before 0.1.0 belong to the
upstream repositories (StillDeadcode/vllm-radiance, ggz14/radiance-vllm-mxfp4).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-24

### Changed
- **vLLM 0.29.0 → 0.30.0**, aiter 0.1.21.post2 → 0.1.22.post1, torchvision 0.24.1 → 0.29.0, ubuntu:24.04
  digest, all Python pins re-resolved for vLLM 0.30 (`constraints.txt`: 209 pins, 34 changed, new
  `mooncake-transfer-engine-rocm` and `msgpack`; `setuptools` held at 79.0.1 because vLLM requires `<80`).
- Four patch anchors moved in vLLM 0.30 and were re-anchored for both versions (`apply_any`):
  `sly/patch_quark_mxfp4` (multi-line `_resolve_backend_kernels`), `sly/patch_lmhead_fp8` / `_int4`
  (`get_quant_method` now opens with `get_quant_method_target`), `patch_autoround` / `patch_escha`
  (`__all__` gained `resolve_quant_method`). `patch_unpad`, `patch_qwen3_toolparse` and
  `sly/patch_mamba_align_retire` are no-ops now: vLLM ships the same fixes.
- CI: ruff 0.16.8, renovate action v46.3.3, `create-github-app-token` v3.
- Renovate: no hourly or concurrent PR cap any more (updates were piling up rate-limited).
- Docs: README cut down to stack, reference numbers, quickstart, changes, options; details moved to
  `docs/`; this changelog; GitHub releases carry the changelog section.

### Measured
- See the release A/B in [docs/BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md#040) (production arguments, 300 W).

## [0.3.6] - 2026-09-24

### Added
- **NVFP4 checkpoints** via load-time requantization to MXFP4 (`RADIANCE_NVFP4_MXFP4=1`, ggz14's
  `radiance_nvfp4`), onto the same W4A8 kernel: `unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4` serves at the Quark
  decode speed, KV 374,202 tokens, GSM8K 0.825. Fixed a meta-tensor crash at load on the way.
- **ParoQuant** (`RADIANCE_PAROQUANT=1`), **AutoRound** (`RADIANCE_AUTOROUND=1`) and **escha**
  (`RADIANCE_ESCHA=1`) quantization configs and HIP kernels (ggz14), all opt-in. ParoQuant works on
  one card (GSM8K 0.84) but is not tuned for it (decode 67.7 tok/s).

## [0.3.5] - 2026-09-24

### Added
- **libr4d extras** (ggz14's rx10 patch, rebased onto our pin): GDN decode/prefill kernels for the
  bf16 SSM cache now bind instead of the FLA fallback. **Prefill +4.9 … +6.0 %**, step gap −0.7 ms,
  decode +1 %, KV pool unchanged, GSM8K 0.845.
- Multi-GPU paths for other users (untested on the maintainer's single card): TP=3 via zero-weight
  dummy heads (`RADIANCE_TP_PAD=3`, needs `RADIANCE_MXFP4_WPERM=0`), TP=2 all-reduce knobs
  (`RADIANCE_AR_MAX_KB`, …); TP=4/8 use libr4d's N-rank kernels.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-09-24

### Added
- froggeric's fixed Qwen chat template v22.5 at `/opt/qwen-fixed.jinja` (`--chat-template`).

## [0.3.3] - 2026-09-23

### Added
- HIP port of vLLM's fused GDN MTP decode kernel (`RADIANCE_GDN_FUSED_DECODE=1`, default off).

## [0.3.2] - 2026-09-24

### Changed
- Image halved (9.4 → 4.8 GB: ROCm prune to gfx1201, venv split into a stable and a volatile layer,
  so a release pull is ~35 MB); every PyPI dependency pinned in `constraints.txt`.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-09-23

### Changed
- `RADIANCE_MXFP4_WPERM=1` (fragment-order weights) permutes into the weight's own storage: step gap
  38.5 → 37.2 ms, weighted decode +3.7 %, KV pool back to 384,316.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added
- Fragment-tiled activations from the fused norm/quant producers feed the A-tiled prefill GEMM
  (`RADIANCE_MXFP4_A_TILED_MIN_M=513`): **prefill +11 … +13 %**, bit-identical.

## [0.2.9] - 2026-09-21

### Added
- Prompt lookup on top of the DFlash draft (`RADIANCE_LOOKUP_DRAFT`, default on): text that repeats
  something more than 2048 tokens back (edits, quotes) decodes **+57 … +116 %** faster, lossless.

## [0.2.8] - 2026-09-20

### Added
- Split-KV launch for the DFlash2 drafter's sliding-window attention: 1.8–3.5× per call, step
  −0.2 … −1.6 ms.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed
- The fp8 verify-batch decode attention tune never applied since aiter 0.1.21; ported to the new config
  tables. **Long-context decode +56 % at 33k, +122 % at 65k, +147 % at 99k tokens.**

## [0.2.6] - 2026-09-19

### Changed
- Ledger: unused upstream patches documented with reasons.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed
- Load-time `max_split_size_mb` allocator scope on ROCm: KV pool +10k tokens (MXFP4), +73k (INT4).

## [0.2.4] - 2026-09-17

### Added
- int4 lm_head for compressed-tensors targets, INT4 target tile table.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed
- Backport of vllm#55450: Mamba align-mode state retirement across null gaps (a 258k prompt exhausted
  the KV pool and preempted itself).

## [0.2.2] - 2026-09-17

### Added
- KV group size override and int4/int8 `embed_tokens`: +1.2–1.7 GiB for the KV cache.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-16

### Changed
- Measured decode cell table for M in (8, 64] (2–8 concurrent sequences).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-16

### Changed
- Merged the full upstream/ggz14 history (243 commits); the active image stayed the same.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-09-16

### Added
- Fused add+RMSNorm / SiLU·mul / GDN gated norm + fp8 quant in front of the W4A8 GEMMs: conc 1 +3 %,
  conc 8 +5.6 %.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-09-15

### Added
- int4 lm_head (W4A16, group 128): step 42.0 → 39.7 ms at conc 1, +8k KV tokens.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-09-15

### Added
- gfx1201 tile table for the DFlash2 W4A16 drafter GEMMs: step 43.4 → 42.0 ms.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-09-15

### Added
- fp8 lm_head: step 48 → 44.5 ms, +1.27 GiB KV.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-09-15

### Added
- DFlash2 with a W4A16 drafter; `DEC_MAX_N` 36864 puts `gate_up` on the decode kernel: step 67 → 48 ms.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-14

### Added
- gfx1201 `gemm_afp4wfp4` config for AITER (the gfx950 default crashed on RDNA4's 64 KiB LDS).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added
- Fork of StillDeadcode/vllm-radiance with ggz14's MXFP4 work, ported to vLLM 0.29.0.
